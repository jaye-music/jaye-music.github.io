# Hi, this is JAYE!
I am a multimedia composer who loves games and film. 

I build things up from scratch. And when I don't like it, I do it all over again, and again. 

I'm never afraid to do that.

My music is just like me - always fresh, always daring, always new.

Let's make something special together!
